# webscraping-challenge

## Background

This project represents a comprehensive effort in web-scraping and data analysis, building upon foundational skills in HTML element identification, automated browsing with Splinter, and HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup. 

Libraries used: BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Splinter, Matplotlib

## Part 1: Mars News Articles

Part one involves using Splinter alongside Chrome DevTools and BeautifulSoup to extract news articles from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html. The article results are then compiled into a JSON file named mars_articles.json, located within the data_export directory.

## Part 2: Mars Weather Analysis

In part two of this project, I use Beautiful Soup to extract weather data from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. The data is then organized into a Pandas DataFrame and exported as mars_weather.csv located in the data_export directory. As a final analysis, I use Matplotlib to explore weather trends on Mars.
